# Adaptable code

This talk is focused on backend and its examples are using Laravel. The concepts will translate to any framework and
_probably_ applicable to frontend too.

I'm using MKdocs so it can serve as both a presentation (with syntax highlighting) and later reference.

It does mean there is more text than a presentation should have.

## What is the goal of this talk?

It's meant to inform and inspire. It's not meant to imply anything _must_ be done like this.  
After this I'd also really like to hear of any other approaches to similar problems.
